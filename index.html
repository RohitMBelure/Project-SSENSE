      "In our own time, we don’t call Saint Augustine’s Confessions a celebrity memoir, even though he’s famous and it’s his life story. There are plenty of people who become famous for their memoirs, like Elizabeth Wurtzel or Anne Frank, but we don’t call them celebrity memoirists either. That’s because the “celebrity” element is for us something that has to predate the composition of the memoir, having been forged outside the field of literature.",
    body2:
      "The celebrity memoir is a slippery little genre—books and fame in an odd tango with one another from the start. The word celebrity has been a part of English since the late medieval period, from Latin celebritatas, then synonymous with fame, from Latin fama, meaning “rumor.” Antoine Lilti has argued that celebrity culture began in eighteenth-century Europe, as fandoms of similar types developed for philosopher Voltaire, actor David Garrick, and pianist-composer Franz Liszt. We read the first brushes of the term “celebrity” with derision in this period: In his 1742 translation of a biography of Cervantes, for example, the English writer John Ozell writes, “One of the best Proofs of the Celebrity of any Book, is the quick Sale of it. Ozell seizes on the notion of celebrity as some force external to–and perhaps in conflict with—literary merit,The formula “celebrity [noun]”—the word in its attributive sense, as in “celebrity hairdresser” or “celebrity memoir”—first appeared in the late nineteenth century. New media forms were jostling in the explosive new market for entertainment derived from photography. In the highbrow version of early photo-celebrity culture, the renowned Shakespearean actress Ellen Terry appeared in several photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron, who also created the first literary photo-book, an 1874 edition of Tennyson’s Idylls of the King. It’s harder to tell what was going on with the lowbrow form of print-based entertainment, because culture tends to discard what it feels is unimportant or shameful. If there were celebrities of the mid-nineteenth century erotic photography scene, for example, we don’t remember them the way we remember, say, Sarah Bernhardt, the French actor often dubbed the “first celebrity.” As Sharon Marcus notes in her 2019 book The Drama of Celebrity, Bernhardt used photographs, the penny press, and all kinds of modern modes of transportation to build her brand.",

O’Dwyer graduated from London’s Royal College of Art in 2018, her final collection comprising lustrous, resin-like moulded pieces. While pioneering in its own right by virtue of the materials she chose to work with, incorporating fiber glass and silicone, what was ultimately refreshing about the collection—and perhaps the most profound characteristic of her brand—is O’Dwyer’s dedication to size inclusivity. “The attempt to think about bodies that aren’t thin in fashion is so in its infancy,” she says, “that’s very much my motivation to rethink and redefine how we see bodies with fat, and how we dress them.”",

For every promising pulse forward, we are drawn back by trend forecasts announcing the return of “heroin chic,” or by the lackadaisical reporting of certain celebrities shedding body weight by way of sauna suit and strict diet for the sake of fitting into a dress for fifteen minutes. This is what O’Dwyer aims to interrogate through her work as a designer—deciphering the coded practices of design and clothing-making to subvert and challenge the ways in which luxury fashion is fundamentally skewed. “We’re just at the beginning, really,” she says on an April afternoon in her Hoxton studio. “If you think of luxury fashion as the highest art form in fashion design, and then ignore everyone who is in a fat body, then you’re not seeing bodies with fat on them as luxury, or as equal—it’s really damaging.",

      "For Josh Itiola, it was through the lens of a camera that he first saw the rooms he occupied. An engineer by education and a planner with the design-forward furniture company Vitsœ, Itiola became interested in interiors as a young man, photographing the architecture in his hometown of New York City. Driven by intuition–a desire to “taste everything,” as he puts it–Itiola began to consider the insides of the buildings that encompassed him. Interiors were not just places where we slept, cooked, or worked, but opportunities to put ourselves at the center of comfort, beauty, and functionality.Now, an inhabitant of one of the most elegantly striking, personally-designed apartments (online and off) you could dream of, Itiola is, as all interesting people are, as much about what he doesn’t show. There are the projects he’s working on in the half-bedroom-turned-office of his Bed-Stuy apartment, which Itiola would rather not talk about at the moment; there is the office itself, which he won’t share pictures of on his highly commented-upon Instagram account. Then there are the careful angles of his immaculately furnished apartment, filled with art and objects that reveal Itiola’s taste for European designer/architects like Ettore Sottsass, Gaetano Pesce, Ingo Maurer, and Afra and Tobia Scarpa. Between the flashes of Italian excess are glimpses of influential Black painters like Kerry James Marshall and Jacob Lawrence. Lamps crane their necks in all directions to show you where to look—many of them rewired by Itiola himself.At heart, Itiola is a collector of three-dimensional intrigue, committed to moving things and putting them back together until they resonate with his vision. And sometimes that means putting his treasures in a place where only he can enjoy them.",

    body2:
      "Among other things, you share a lot of photographs of your home on your Instagram. How do you deal with the intimacy that comes with that?I do sometimes feel weird about showing my apartment. More now than before, because it’s been shown in more places, like the Architectural Digest piece. I’m a very private person, but my apartment is a personal project of mine. I want to show what I do, what I can do. And I don’t show most of it! No one knows what my closet or bathroom looks like. No one knows what my kitchen looks like.A kitchen is such a personal space.Yeah, exactly. My friends see my kitchen when I cook for them. [Laughs]What does being a Vitsœ planner entail?I deal with Vitsœ furniture itself. Our most popular product is the 606 Universal Shelving System, which has many components. My main job is to help clients configure our system to their personal needs.You’ve said that you like challenging spaces that require you to be technical. Can you give me an example of a problem you solved in a space that you planned for someone?This has happened a couple of times—and I really enjoy it—where we do a system that compresses between the floor and the ceiling and we need to know exact ceiling measurements. We have systems that are attached to the wall and others that can compress and divide space. This client wanted to do a compressed system, but their ceiling sloped. Our posts are cut to length for your ceiling height, but now you technically have multiple ceiling heights because of this slope. I had to get specific height measurements from, like, five inches from the wall, then 35 inches from the wall, and on and on, to make sure that the system, once installed, would appear as one straight unit, even though in actuality, it’s tilted.",
